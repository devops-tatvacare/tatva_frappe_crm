// TATVA: the WhatsApp history refresh is a QUEUED job, not a request. It walks the provider's API
// for 5-15 seconds — long enough that a synchronous call leaves the rep on a dead screen, short
// enough that nobody builds for it. tatva_connect/api/whatsapp.py enqueues and reports through
// Frappe's own realtime channel: ONE event, `whatsapp_refresh`, carrying its own state.
//
// State lives at MODULE scope, not in Activities.vue, for two reasons:
//   * the job outlives the component. A listener inside onMounted dies when the rep navigates away,
//     and the completion toast dies with it — which is the whole thing being asked for.
//   * two tabs on the same lead must agree on whether a refresh is in flight. A local ref cannot.
//
// Keyed by LEAD, because "is a refresh running" is a question about a lead, not about the app.
// Same shape as presence/notify: one start* attached to the app socket from App.vue, one guard.

// it. The button then reads "Refreshing…" for the life of the page.
